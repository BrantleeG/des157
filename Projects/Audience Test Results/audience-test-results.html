<p>The target audience test was very helpful to gain insight on potential issues with my website. Each of the three participants gave me helpful feedback that I used to develop new ideas of how to construct the website and make sure that it would fulfill its intended purpose in the most efficient and enjoyable way possible.</p>
<p>The users sat down and tried to navigate the site, completing each of the 3 tasks that I had assigned to them. The first was navigating the site using the "country" button on the main page, the second was using the "action" button to navigate the site. The third was to return to the home page before completing the sequence that results in the page with a comparison.</p>
<p>From this experience I was able to step back from my idea and understand how other people interpreted my work. The most common issue was the use of 2 different pages for country selection, many users didn't know why there had to be 2 separate pages to accomplish this. Having less pages would make the site more easily navigable. As for the main menu page, the description should be a little more detailed as to what information the site is presenting to the user. It was also important to include some simple instructions to help guide the user. Users enjoyed less content over too much.</p>

<p>Some updates I plan on making include menu buttons that don't initially appear as just images, a more detailed description & instructions, using checkmarks to select multiple countries instead of having 2 pages, adding a back button, and possibly pages with general information based on country about social etiquette in that region.</p>
