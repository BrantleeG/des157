  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">One of the most important skillsets to have in today's global society is good communication skills, but often we find that there are barriers such as differences in language, culture, and social etiquette that prevent us from presenting ourselves to others in the way we desire. Wouldn't it be great if we were able to seamlessly communicate with people all over the world? My project is designed to help people understand the differences in communication styles between different cultures, promoting greater understanding and giving users the tools necessary to navigate life in places that they may be unaccustomed to.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Picture this: John decided that he wants to take a trip to Egypt to see the Great Pyramids and explore the rich cultural heritage of the region. He booked his flight and is in the middle of packing his bag when he realized that he wasn't sure how he would communicate with people in Egypt or what social etiquette he should be aware of. Lucky for John, he remembered there was a website he could go to that would educate him on how people in Egypt interact with each other, and how it differentiates from social interactions in the United States. After using this website, John will now have an easier time communicating courteously while on his trip in Egypt.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The goal of this project is to develop a platform that helps educate users on social etiquette in different countries. It focuses mainly on non-verbal aspects of communication, since we do not expect people to necessarily understand the language of the country they are traveling to. Differences in communication styles can be described through body language, dress, hand gestures, and other non-verbal actions. Images are the focus of the website as they are the most universal form of communication.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Visual media is the best tool we can use to describe physical characteristics or actions. Movement will be represented by graphic icons or gifs to display motion. There will also be a symbol for whether the action has positive or negative attributes associated with it, and an explanation of the meaning/reasoning behind an object/behavior/action using text. By using visual aids, people from different countries will easily be able to interpret what the action or object is, how it is perceived, and perhaps an equivalent in their own society.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Since the most important information will be communicated through pictographs the rest of the website will have a simple design to not distract from the main content. Most of the vivid color will come from the icons/gifs used to illustrate different gestures, body language, etc. Icons will be static images if allowed, and images that require movement won't move until hovered over. Since we want this site to be informative for people from all over it is important to keep the text clear and legible, so the information is easily digestible. Sans-serif fonts will be used and text will be clearly distinguished from the neutral background. There will be an option to select a specific gesture/item and a country selector using different flags and country names.</p>
