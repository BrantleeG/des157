    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">My final project is on how body language, gestures, and communication techniques are perceived in different countries around the world. The goal is to give people a greater understanding of other cultures and their customs, celebrating the diversity in the way we communicate but also showing what makes us similar. Some expressions are universally interpreted in the same way, while others can have different meanings depending on its cultural context. Some countries use more expressive body language, while others are more reserved and may take offense to actions they may consider "exaggerated".</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">While conducting research, I found the best way for people of different cultural backgrounds to interpret and understand information was through the use of visual communication. Visual images are easily understood, and concepts can be translated regardless of the language spoken by the user. Visual communication is becoming increasingly important, especially in the digital landscape. Images and video relay messages faster than reading text and can be processed 60,000 times faster by the brain. With visuals a clear, unified message can be delivered and understood by each individual. By using visual communication, the message will be more direct in its meaning and not be open to the individual's own interpretation. A consistent experience among each user is important, the website should operate in the same manner and return similar results for everyone that interacts with it. Furthermore, visual communication results in better retention of information. The result of using visual communication as the driving force behind the website's design is people gaining a greater understanding of other cultures and the way they interpret body language.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">While searching for content on body language interpretation around the world, I noticed that the majority of information was explained through infographics. Symbols or images were used to communicate the motion for each gesture and followed with a description of the gesture and a list of countries to which this gesture had different meanings. It was surprising to see the varied difference in the meaning of certain movements from one culture to the next! Some cultures or regions had similar positive or negative attributes to expressive movements or focused attention on individuals. From analyzing these infographics, I realized that it was important to emphasize the similarities in interpretation between different cultures. By representing body language through an easily-understood visual format people from different backgrounds will be able to discern what the action is, regardless of what language they speak. From there the action can be dissected into ways that it is interpreted among people from different regions. Visual cues such as flags are helpful for identifying countries and categorizing them by similarities in their perception helps break down cultural context.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">When trying to develop a platform that could be easily interpreted by everyone, I pondered how I would be able to convey gestures in a way that could be universally understood. I recalled the symbols I saw in airports, on street signs, and inside buildings. These symbols, developed by AIGA, are universally understood and interpreted the same by people all over the world. Creating universal symbols for common gestures would be helpful for people of different cultures to interpret their meaning. Making them animated would further facilitate their understanding of the gesture, in essence creating a simplified version of said motion in real life. By creating a platform with a good amount of visual stimulation, users will be more enticed to interact with objects. This results in extended usage and hopefully, after reading about each gesture, a greater understanding of the interpretation of body language in cultures similar and different from their own.</p>
