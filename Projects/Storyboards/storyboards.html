  <p>In my initial storyboard I used visual images to convey the meaning behind the story. The story is of a man who wants to travel to Egypt, but realizes he does not know how to effectively communicate with the people there. Using the app, he learns what is socially appropriate behavior in Egypt. The man ends up having a much better time while there as a result.</p>

  <p>I wanted to be more descriptive to explain the purpose of the app and how it would help the user, so I added written explanations. These detail to the viewer how the app will help the man understand social ettiquette in Egypt, leading to a better stay.</p>
